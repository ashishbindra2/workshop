### Q67. Assignment: Number to Word Converter

- Your task is to write a program that takes an integer as input from the user and displays the corresponding word for that number. For example, if the user enters "1", the program should display "one". The program should be able to handle numbers between 0 and 999.
- Here are the rules for the conversion:
- Numbers 0 to 20 should be converted to their corresponding word (e.g.. 0 should be "zero", 1 should be "one", and so on).
- Numbers from 21 to 99 should be converted to words by combining the words for the tens place and the ones place. For example, 23 should be "twenty-three", and 99 should be "ninety-nine".
- Numbers from 100 to 999 should be converted to words by combining the words for the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place. For example, 325 should be "three hundred twenty-five".
- Your program should display an error message if the user enters a number outside of the range of 0 to 99999.

```py

```

### Q68. Bank Account Creation with Random Account Numbers and Initial Balance

- You are hired by a new bank to develop a system for automatically generating account numbers when a customer creates a new bank account. The system needs to:
- Generate a random, unique account number for each customer. The account number should be a 10-digit number.
- Allow the customer to set an initial deposit for the account, which must be greater than or equal to zero.
- If the customer tries to deposit a negative amount, the account creation should be denied.
- Each account should have a customer name attached to it.
- After creating the account, display the account number, customer name, and initial balance.
- The account should be stored in a dictionary, with the account number as the key and the account details (name and balance) as the value.

```py

```

### Q69. Username Generator for Email System

- A company wants to automate the creation of email usernames for new employees. The email address should be generated based on the employee's full name. Write a Python program that:
- Takes the employee's full name (first and last name) as input.
- Converts the name into a lowercase username with the format first initial + last name (e.g., John Doe → jdoe).
- If the last name contains any spaces or special characters, they should be removed from the username.
- Ensure that the final username contains only lowercase letters and no spaces.
- If the username already exists, append a number to it (e.g., jdoe1, jdoe2).
- ***Hint:*** You will need to use string manipulation functions to handle formatting and ensure uniqueness.

```py

```

### Q69. Palindrome Substring Finder

- You are working on a project to detect palindrome substrings in a given string. Write a Python program that:
- Takes a sentence as input.
- Identifies and returns all unique palindromic substrings (strings that read the same forward and backward) of at least 3 characters.
- Your program should ignore punctuation and spaces while checking for palindromes, but should return the palindromic substrings with their original punctuation intact.
- Example:
  - Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
  - Output: ["ama", "ana", "A man a plan a canal Panama"]
- ***Hint:*** Use string slicing and helper functions to clean the input, check for palindromes, and extract substrings.

```py

```

### Q70. Encrypted Message Decryption

- You have intercepted a secret message that has been encrypted by reversing the words and shifting the characters in the alphabet by a certain number. Write a Python program that:
- Takes a reversed encrypted message and the shift value as input.
- Reverses the entire message so the words are in the correct order.
- Shifts the characters back by the given shift value to reveal the original message (e.g., a shift of 2 means 'c' becomes 'a', 'b' becomes 'z', etc.).
- Ensure that only alphabetic characters are shifted (leave spaces and punctuation unchanged).
- Example:
  - Encrypted Input: "khoor zruog" (with a shift of 3)
  - Decrypted Output: "hello world"
- ***Hint:*** You will need to use string methods and implement a custom Caesar cipher for character shifting.

```py

```

### Q71. Longest Word Without Repeated Characters

- You are developing a word puzzle game. One of the challenges is to find the longest word in a sentence where no letter repeats. Write a Python program that:
- Takes a sentence as input.
- Splits the sentence into individual words.
- Finds and returns the longest word where no letter appears more than once.
- If there are multiple words of the same length, return the one that appears first in the sentence.
- Example:
  - Input: "I am programming with Python"
  - Output: "with"
- ***Hint:*** You'll need to check each word for uniqueness using string operations and sets.

```py

```

### Q72. Anagram Grouping System

- You are working for a word game company, and they want a system to group words that are anagrams of each other. Write a Python program that:
- Takes a list of words as input (e.g., ["listen", "silent", "enlist", "google", "gogole", "god"]).
- Groups all words that are anagrams of each other (words that can be rearranged to form the same string) into lists.
- Outputs a list of lists, where each sublist contains the anagram group.
- Example:
  - Input: ["listen", "silent", "enlist", "google", "gogole", "god", "dog"]
  - Output: [["listen", "silent", "enlist"], ["google", "gogole"], ["god", "dog"]]
- ***Hint:*** You can use sorting or dictionaries with string operations to identify anagram groups.

```py

```

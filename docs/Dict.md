In Python, the term **"hashable"** is used to describe an object that has a hash value that remains constant during its lifetime. In the context of dictionaries, hashable objects are critical because they are used as **keys**.

### **What Does Hashable Mean?**
1. **Hash Value**:  
   A hash value is a fixed-size integer that uniquely identifies an object, generated by the `hash()` function.  

2. **Immutability**:  
   To be hashable, an object must be immutable. This ensures that its hash value does not change over time, which is a key requirement for dictionary keys.

3. **Equality and Hashing**:  
   Hashable objects must implement the `__hash__()` method to compute the hash value and the `__eq__()` method for equality checks. Python dictionaries use these methods to organize and retrieve keys efficiently.

### **Why Hashable Is Important for Dictionaries**
- **Key Uniqueness**:  
  Dictionary keys must be unique. Python uses the hash value of a key to quickly determine where to store or find a value in the dictionary.
  
- **Efficient Lookups**:  
  The hash value allows the dictionary to find a key in **O(1)** time complexity on average.

### **Hashable Objects**
Objects that are immutable (and hence hashable) include:
- **Strings**:  
  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}  # 'name' is hashable
  ```
- **Numbers (int, float, etc.)**:  
  ```python
  my_dict = {42: "Answer"}  # 42 is hashable
  ```
- **Tuples (if all elements are hashable)**:  
  ```python
  my_dict = {(1, 2): "coordinates"}  # (1, 2) is hashable
  ```

---

### **Unhashable Objects**
Objects that are mutable (and hence not hashable) include:
- **Lists**:  
  Lists are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys.  
  ```python
  my_dict = {[1, 2]: "List"}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
  ```
  
- **Sets**:  
  Like lists, sets are mutable and unhashable.  
  ```python
  my_dict = {set([1, 2]): "Set"}  # Raises TypeError
  ```

---

### **Custom Hashable Objects**
You can make a custom object hashable by defining the `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods.

#### Example:
```python
class MyHashableClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.value)  # Use the hash of 'value'

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, MyHashableClass) and self.value == other.value

# Using custom hashable object as dictionary key
key = MyHashableClass(42)
my_dict = {key: "Custom Object"}
print(my_dict[key])  # Output: Custom Object
```

---

### **Key Points in the Context of Dictionaries**
1. A dictionary key **must be hashable**.
2. Hashable objects allow Python to store dictionary keys in a hash table for fast lookups.
3. If you attempt to use an unhashable object as a key, Python will raise a `TypeError`.

#### Example:
```python
# Hashable example
hashable_key = "name"
my_dict = {hashable_key: "Alice"}
print(my_dict[hashable_key])  # Output: Alice

# Unhashable example
unhashable_key = [1, 2, 3]  # A list
my_dict = {unhashable_key: "List"}  # Raises TypeError
```

By ensuring that objects used as dictionary keys are hashable, Python maintains the efficiency and reliability of its dictionary implementation.

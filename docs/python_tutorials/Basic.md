# Introduction to Python

## About Python

- Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language.
- It was developed by **Guido van Rossum** in 1989 at the National Research Institute in the Netherlands.
- Python was officially released to the public on **February 20, 1991**.
- Python is highly recommended as a first programming language for beginners due to its simplicity.

## Examples

### Example 1: Print "Hello World"

**Java:**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

**C:**

```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main() {
    printf("Hello World");
}
```

**Python:**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

---

### Example 2: Sum of Two Numbers

**Java:**

```java
public class Add {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a, b;
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
        System.out.println("The Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
}
```

**C:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int a, b;
    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    printf("The Sum: %d", (a + b));
}
```

**Python:**

```python
a = 10
b = 20
print("The Sum:", (a + b))
```

## Origin of the Name "Python"

The name **Python** was inspired by the British comedy TV show *"Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus"* broadcasted by the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

---

## Language Influences

Guido van Rossum designed Python by borrowing features from various programming languages:

- **Functional programming**: C
- **Object-oriented programming**: C++
- **Scripting features**: Perl, Shell Script
- **Modular programming**: Modula-3
- Syntax is mostly derived from **C** and **ABC languages**.

## Applications of Python

Python can be used in a wide variety of areas:

1. Desktop Applications
2. Web Applications
3. Database Applications
4. Network Programming
5. Game Development
6. Data Analysis
7. Machine Learning
8. Artificial Intelligence
9. Internet of Things (IoT)

> **Note:**
> Python is used by companies like **Google**, **Microsoft**, **IBM**, **Yahoo**.
> It's also used in **YouTube**, **NASA**, and **New York Stock Exchange**.

## Features of Python

1. **Simple and Easy to Learn**

   - Python code reads like English.
   - Minimal syntax, around 30+ keywords.
   - Fewer lines of code for the same logic compared to other languages.

2. **Free and Open Source**

   - No license needed to use Python.
   - Source code is open for modification (e.g., Jython for Java integration).

3. **High-Level Language**

   - Programmer-friendly; no need to manage memory or security manually.

4. **Platform Independent**

   - Write once, run anywhere (PVM handles platform translation).

5. **Portable**

   - Code produces the same result across platforms.

6. **Dynamically Typed**

   - No need to declare variable types explicitly.
   - Type is inferred at runtime.

7. **Supports Both Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming**

8. **Interpreted Language**

   - Compilation handled by Python Interpreter.
   - Errors raised at runtime if any.

9. **Extensible**

   - Can integrate code from other languages for performance or legacy reuse.

10. **Embeddable**

    - Python code can be embedded within other languages.

11. **Extensive Library Support**

- Large standard library with built-in functions and modules.

## Limitations of Python

1. **Performance**

   - Slower than compiled languages due to interpretation.

2. **Not Commonly Used for Mobile Development**

## Flavors of Python

| Flavor         | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| CPython        | Standard implementation using C             |
| Jython/JPython | For Java applications (runs on JVM)         |
| IronPython     | For C#/.NET applications                    |
| PyPy           | JIT compiler support for faster performance |
| RubyPython     | Integrates Python with Ruby                 |
| AnacondaPython | Optimized for data processing and analytics |

## Python Versions

| Version    | Release Date  |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Python 1.0 | January 1994  |
| Python 2.0 | October 2000  |
| Python 3.0 | December 2008 |

> **Note:**
> Python 3 does **not** provide backward compatibility with Python 2.
> Python 2 programs may not run on Python 3 without modifications.

**Current Common Versions:**

### 76. Python Program to Differentiate Between type() and isinstance()

```py

class Polygon:
    def sides_no(self):
        pass

class Triangle(Polygon):
    def area(self):
        pass

obj_polygon = Polygon()
obj_triangle = Triangle()

print(type(obj_triangle) == Triangle)    # true
print(type(obj_triangle) == Polygon)     # false

print(isinstance(obj_polygon, Polygon))  # true
print(isinstance(obj_triangle, Polygon)) # true
```

we see that type() cannot distinguish whether an instance of a class is somehow related to the base class.

- In our case, although obj_triangle is an instance of child class Triangle,
- it is inherited from the base class Polygon. If you want to relate the object of a child class with the base class,
- you can achieve this with isinstance().

### 80. Python Program to Return Multiple Values From a Function

```py
# Example 1: Return values using comma
def name():
    return "John","Armin"

# print the tuple with the returned values
print(name())

# get the individual items
name_1, name_2 = name()
print(name_1, name_2)
```

### 88. Python Program to Compute the Power of a Number

```py title="1"
# Calculate the power of a number using pow() function
base = 3
exponent = 4

result = pow(base, exponent)
print("Answer = " + str(result))
```

```py
# Calculate power of a number using a for loop
base = 3
exponent = 4

result = 1

for exponent in range(exponent, 0, -1):
    result *= base

print("Answer = " + str(result))
```

```py
# Calculate power of a number using a while loop
base = 3
exponent = 4

result = 1

while exponent != 0:
    result *= base
    exponent-=1

print("Answer = " + str(result))
```

```py
base = 3
exponent = 4
exponent+=1
result =1

while exponent:=  exponent-1:
    result *= base
result
```

```py
base = 3
exponent = 4
result =1

while exponent:
    result *= base
    exponent-=1

result

```

### 89.  Python Program to Count the Number of Digits Present In a Number

```py
num = 1234567

def count_digits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        n = n // 10
        count += 1
    return count

digit_count = count_digits(abs(num)) 
print(digit_count)
```
